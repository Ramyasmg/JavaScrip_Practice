<p>Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, 
    such as those made by mice. They can also see in near darkness
    Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans. <br>
    Domestic and wild cats share a gene mutation that leaves them with no ability to taste sweetness
    The average life expectancy for male indoor cats at birth is around 12 to 14 years.<br>
    However, there have been reports of cats reaching into their 30s, 
    with the oldest known cat, Creme Puff, dying at a verified age of 38.</p><br>
