    JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that 
    allows you to make web pages interactive.<br> 
    Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, 
    JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.<br> 
    Common examples of JavaScript are search box on Amazon,
     a news recap video embedded on The New York Times, or refreshing Twitter feed etc. <br>

    Incorporating JavaScript improves the user experience of the web page by converting it 
from a static page into an interactive one. JavaScript adds behavior to web pages.
